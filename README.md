# Andy's Weater App

After completing several React tutorials I'm putting my newly gained skills to the test in order to develop React Weather App from scratch, with dynamic interactive interface.<br/>
Its interface consists of three tabs, one for the list of five pre-defined cities, another one allows user to create custom list, and the last one to display interactive Earth Globe/Map.

## Key features:

- functional components
- consuming OpenWeatherMap API with AXIOS.
- react-router-dom v6
- pigeon-map
- react-globe.gl
- Drag & Drop
- responsive design & animations for better UX
